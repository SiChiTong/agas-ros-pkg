OrObjectPropertiesM

Message OrObjectPropertiesM was replaced by direct method call.
Other classes in the framework that need this message:
- GUI: ObjectList --> probably only for display
- ORAutoLearningModule --> to automatically learn and add objects --> can be replaced by direct method call aswell
